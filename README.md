Architecture

In building the full stack web app, I used a few different types of frontend development: Express HTML, JavaScript, and an Angular single-page application (SPA). Express HTML is basic, showing server-generated pages for the customer side. JavaScript adds some interactivity, allowing parts of the page to change without a full reload. The Angular SPA,
used for the admin side, creates a faster experience by only loading specific parts of the page as needed.
For the backend, I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, it works well with flexible data. MongoDB is good for scaling up and handles data as documents, which fits well with JavaScript objects, making the data flow smoothly between the frontend and backend.

Functionality

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a data format different from JavaScript but looks similar. JSON connects the frontend and backend by making data transfer easy to read and use on both sides. I used JSON often to pass information from the backend to the frontend.
I also made my code better by using reusable Angular components, which allowed me to create standard elements that could be used throughout the app. This saved time and made the app easier to update, as any changes in one component would automatically apply everywhere it was used.

Testing

Testing made sure that the appâ€™s API endpoints worked correctly, even with added security. I tested various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to ensure everything functioned as expected. Adding security, like authentication, required me to test things like tokens to confirm only the right users could access certain parts of the app. 
Testing for security added complexity, but it helped secure the app.

Reflection

This course taught me a lot about full stack development by letting me work on both frontend and backend in one project. I improved my skills with Angular SPAs, created and secured RESTful APIs, and learned to manage data with MongoDB. These skills make me more confident and job-ready as a developer, allowing me to take on more challenging web projects 
and making me a stronger candidate for future roles.
